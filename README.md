# i3-xfce4-antergos
my settings to use 3 as a WM inside XFCE4 under Antergos Linux
will also work for pure Archlinux

# simple:
* XFCE (session settings) 
* remove xfcewm and xfcedesktop from starting up 
* add autostarter for i3-wm
remove all panels

I just start up with the default XFCE-install from Antergos, and adding i3-wm packages from my list of packages:
`cat packages.txt | xargs yaourt -S --needed --noconfirm`
